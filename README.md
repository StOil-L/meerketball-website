## Context

This project was carried out during my studies at the University of Montpellier as a second year Computer Science Bachelors Degree student.

It constitutes as the sole assignment for the L2 Programming Project subject (subject code: HLIN405).

Meerketball is a basketball tournament management website. Its frontend is handled with HTML, CSS and JavaScript while its backend uses PHP and a MySQL database, managed with PHPMyAdmin.
